# RayPDF


This project is intended to be my default PDF reader. By reaching the 1.0.0 milestone, it will already have become my default PDF reader.
It is built with RayLib, a minimal graphics library intended for game develpment but I used it primarily for GUI.

## Note

Note that I am only learning. There are so many inconsistencies in the configuration. This is just a practice project but for a real-world application.
By the "end" of the project, I will have gotten enough experience to properly start new projects and learn what to focus on which engineering softwares.
